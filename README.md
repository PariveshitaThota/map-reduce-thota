Practising mapping and reducing

## Pariveshita Thota
I am learning a new concept in Big Data called map-reduce and practising and showing the outcome of the results in mapping and reducing.

## Type of Data
As GitHub is the most popular public collaboration and file-sharing platform, analyzing the languages that are used for repositories, PRs, and issues on GitHub and be a good indicator for the popularity of a language. As we work on most of the time with Git, I have invested some amount of time in finding a dataset in Kaggle and extracted an interesting dataset which is "Github Programming on Data". In this dataset it consists names of different kinds of programming languages associated with various years and also with the specific count

## Big Data Problem
The Big Data problem I have choosen is to extract a dataset that contains statistics about the programming languages used for issues on GitHub. The data is from 2011 to 2021.
